# üöÄ EAIA is Ready to Deploy!

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working
1. **Gmail Integration**: Both accounts configured and working
   - patrick@highline.work (5,876 messages)
   - patrick.smith@gmail.com (285,856 messages)
2. **AWS Secrets**: All Gmail credentials securely stored
3. **Configuration**: Personalized config.yaml with your preferences
4. **OpenAI API**: Connected and working
5. **Graph Structure**: LangGraph compiled with 14 nodes

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Non-blocking)
1. **Anthropic API**: Key might need refresh (401 error)
   - Won't block deployment, EAIA can use OpenAI
2. **LangSmith API Key**: Not set yet
   - Required for deployment to LangGraph Cloud

## Immediate Next Steps

### Option 1: Deploy to LangGraph Cloud (Recommended)

1. **Get LangSmith Plus Account**
   ```
   Go to: https://smith.langchain.com
   Sign up for Plus account ($39/month)
   Get API key from Settings
   ```

2. **Set LangSmith API Key**
   ```bash
   export LANGSMITH_API_KEY='ls__your_key_here'
   ```

3. **Generate Deployment Config**
   ```bash
   poetry run python scripts/setup_langgraph_cloud_env.py
   ```

4. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "EAIA configured for Patrick Smith"
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/executive-ai-assistant.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

5. **Deploy on LangGraph Cloud**
   - Go to smith.langchain.com ‚Üí Deployments
   - New Deployment ‚Üí LangGraph Cloud
   - Use environment variables from ~/.eaia_deployment_env.txt

### Option 2: Test Locally First

```bash
# Run development server
langgraph dev

# In another terminal, test with recent emails
poetry run python scripts/run_ingest.py --minutes-since 60 --rerun 0 --early 1
```

## What Will Happen

Once deployed, EAIA will:

1. **Check your emails** every 10 minutes (configurable)
2. **Triage them** into three categories:
   - Ignore: Marketing, newsletters, spam (auto-archived)
   - Notify: Important but no response needed
   - Respond: Draft responses for your review

3. **For emails needing response**, EAIA will:
   - Draft in your writing style
   - Include relevant context
   - Send to Agent Inbox for your review

## Safety Features

- ‚úÖ **Approval Required**: All drafts need your approval before sending
- ‚úÖ **Conservative Triage**: Start with strict rules, loosen over time
- ‚úÖ **Full Audit Trail**: All actions logged in LangSmith
- ‚úÖ **Easy Shutdown**: Can pause anytime from LangGraph Cloud

## Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Check credentials
poetry run python scripts/test_both_gmail_accounts.py

# Test local setup
poetry run python scripts/test_local_setup.py

# Export credentials for deployment
poetry run python scripts/export_credentials_for_langgraph.py

# After deployment, test ingestion
python scripts/run_ingest.py --url YOUR_DEPLOYMENT_URL --minutes-since 60
```

## Support & Troubleshooting

1. **Gmail API errors**: Already enabled for both projects ‚úÖ
2. **Wrong email account**: Credentials are correctly mapped
3. **Too many emails**: Start with --minutes-since 60 (last hour)
4. **Anthropic API**: Can refresh key at console.anthropic.com

## üéØ Next Action

**Choose your path:**
- [ ] Get LangSmith Plus and deploy to cloud (recommended)
- [ ] Test locally with langgraph dev first
- [ ] Review and adjust config.yaml triage rules

The system is configured and ready. Just need LangSmith API key to deploy!
