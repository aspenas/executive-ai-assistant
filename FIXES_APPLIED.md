# Fixes Applied to Executive AI Assistant

## âœ… Completed Fixes

### 1. Environment Variables
- Added `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` to .env file (placeholder value)
- **ACTION NEEDED**: Replace the placeholder with your actual Anthropic API key

### 2. Code Fixes (Ready to commit)
- Fixed deprecated imports in `eaia/schemas.py`
- Fixed deprecated imports in `eaia/gmail.py`
- Changed from `langchain_core.pydantic_v1` to direct `pydantic` imports

### 3. Cleanup
- Removed 542 .pyc files
- Removed 72 __pycache__ directories
- Removed 3 .log files

### 4. Non-Critical Issues (No action needed)
- Missing directories `eaia/tools` and `eaia/agent_tools` are not imported anywhere
- These directories are not required for deployment

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

1. **Update your Anthropic API key**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env and replace the placeholder with your actual key
   # ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-YOUR-ACTUAL-KEY-HERE
   ```

2. **Monitor current deployment**:
   - The last build was triggered with API configuration fixes
   - Check: https://smith.langchain.com/deployments/334150fb-c682-489c-a9a1-e1dec7a864c7

3. **If deployment still failing**:
   - The missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY was likely causing initialization failures
   - After adding the real key, trigger a new build

## ðŸ“Š Summary

The main issues were:
- Missing ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (now added as placeholder)
- Deprecated pydantic imports (now fixed)
- Build artifacts cluttering the project (now cleaned)

The deployment should succeed once the real Anthropic API key is added.
