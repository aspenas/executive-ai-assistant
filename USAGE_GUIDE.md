"Hello, can you check my recent emails?"
"What's on my calendar today?"
"Help me draft an email to my team about tomorrow's meeting"
```

### Email Triage
```
"Check my unread emails and categorize them by priority"
"Which emails need immediate attention?"
"Summarize emails from my direct reports"
```

### Meeting Coordination
```
"Find a time for a 1-hour meeting with John and Sarah next week"
"What meetings do I have this afternoon?"
"Reschedule my 3pm meeting to tomorrow"
```

## Advanced Features

### Multi-Step Tasks
The assistant can handle complex, multi-step requests:
```
"Check my emails from the product team, summarize the main issues, 
and draft responses for each one"
```

### Context-Aware Responses
The assistant remembers context within a conversation:
```
You: "What emails do I have from John?"
Assistant: [Shows emails]
You: "Draft a reply to the second one"
```

### Reflection & Analysis
For complex tasks, the assistant can use reflection graphs:
```
"Analyze my meeting patterns over the last month and suggest 
improvements to my schedule"
```

## API Usage (for developers)

### Basic Request
```bash
curl -X POST https://eaia-18a3cdfcc5c1502794a566a108ec4a60.us.langgraph.app/threads/<thread_id>/runs \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "assistant_id": "main",
    "input": {
      "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Check my recent emails"
      }]
    }
  }'
```

### Available Graphs
- `main`: Primary assistant for general tasks
- `cron`: Scheduled tasks and automation
- `general_reflection_graph`: For analytical tasks
- `multi_reflection_graph`: For complex multi-aspect analysis

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: "Find emails from John about the Q3 budget" works better than "Find John's emails"

2. **Use Natural Language**: The assistant understands conversational requests

3. **Leverage Context**: You can refer to previous messages in the conversation

4. **Request Summaries**: For long email threads or multiple items, ask for summaries

5. **Iterate**: If the first response isn't quite right, provide clarification

## Troubleshooting

### If the assistant isn't responding:
1. Check deployment status: Run `python3 check_deployment_quick.py`
2. Verify you're using the correct URL
3. Ensure your API keys are properly configured

### If email access isn't working:
1. The Gmail OAuth may need reauthorization
2. Check that GMAIL_OAUTH_CREDENTIALS is properly set

### If responses seem slow:
1. Complex requests may take 10-30 seconds
2. Email searches with many results take longer
3. The reflection graphs are slower but more thorough
