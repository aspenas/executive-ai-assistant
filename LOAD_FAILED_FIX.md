# Fix for "Load Failed" Error

## Issue Identified
The "Load failed" error was caused by the custom API configuration in `langgraph.json`. The `api_config.py` file was attempting to import and configure the graphs in a way that conflicted with LangGraph's deployment system.

## Fix Applied
1. **Removed API configuration** from `langgraph.json`
   - Deleted the `api` section
   - LangGraph will now use its default API configuration
   - This is the standard approach for LangGraph deployments

2. **Kept all other fixes**:
   - ✅ Model configuration fixes
   - ✅ Anthropic API key
   - ✅ Pydantic import fixes
   - ✅ All dependencies

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Redeployment
- The fix has been pushed (commit 9234503)
- LangGraph should automatically rebuild the deployment
- Build time: typically 5-15 minutes

### Expected Result
Once deployed, you should see:
- ✅ No more "Load failed" error
- ✅ All 4 graphs loaded in Studio
- ✅ Assistant responding to messages
- ✅ Email integration working

## How to Verify

1. **Check LangGraph Studio**:
   - Go to: https://smith.langchain.com/studio
   - Your deployment should work without errors

2. **Test the API**:
   ```bash
   curl https://eaia-18a3cdfcc5c1502794a566a108ec4a60.us.langgraph.app/info \
     -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```
   Should show all graphs in the response.

## Why This Happened

LangGraph 0.3.x has its own API layer that handles:
- Graph registration
- Endpoint routing
- Request handling

Our custom `api_config.py` was trying to override this, causing conflicts during the deployment loading phase.

## Best Practice

For LangGraph deployments:
1. Let LangGraph handle the API layer
2. Focus on graph logic in your code
3. Use `langgraph.json` for configuration
4. Avoid custom API configurations unless specifically needed
