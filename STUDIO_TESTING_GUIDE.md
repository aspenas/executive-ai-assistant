## Test Your Executive AI Assistant

### 1. Basic Functionality Tests

Try these messages in order:

```
"Hello! I'm Patrick. What can you help me with?"
```

```
"What tools and capabilities do you have access to?"
```

```
"Can you check my email?"
```

### 2. Email Integration Test

Your assistant should be able to:
- Check emails from patrick@highline.work and patrick.smith@gmail.com
- Search for specific emails
- Draft responses
- Analyze email patterns

Test commands:
```
"Check my recent emails"
```

```
"Do I have any important emails from today?"
```

```
"Search for emails about meetings"
```

### 3. AWS Secrets Test

```
"Can you access my AWS secrets?"
```

```
"What secrets are available in AWS Secrets Manager?"
```

### 4. AI Capabilities Test

```
"Use your best judgment to help me prioritize my tasks for today"
```

```
"Analyze my recent email patterns and suggest improvements"
```

### 5. Reflection Graph Test

```
"I need help making a complex decision about [topic]. Can you walk me through a thoughtful analysis?"
```

## What to Look For

‚úÖ **Successful Responses**:
